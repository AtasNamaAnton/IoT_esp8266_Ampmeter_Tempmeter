# IoT_esp8266_Ampmeter_Tempmeter
This project is mainly about an Arduino-based multimeter with a capability up to 5A. I've made two types of multimeters for DC and AC currents. The main objective of this project is to measure voltage and current in solar panel systems including solar PV, battery, and inverter as the measured objects.
