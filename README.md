# IoT_esp8266_Ampmeter_Tempmeter
This project is mainly about an IoT-based Amperemeter and temperature meter implemented in a Depok, West Java, Indonesia school. This project uses esp8266 to send data to the dashboard to monitor the energy usage in certain electronic devices, with 60+ nodes in each classroom sending queries every hour.

*Disclaimer* This is not originally my work. I only do the mechanics part here. Again, all of the source code isn't originally mine. Even so, I sincerely hope the code will be useful for those who want to learn.
